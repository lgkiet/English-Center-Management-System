## ðŸ“„ **Project Overview**
This is my personal project, carried out with other team members in the same course. This project is the first step for me to gain knowledge and practical experience in system analysis and design.

## ðŸ“‹ **Introduction**
- ### Introduction
    - The global demand for English language learning has led to the proliferation of English centers. However, many of these centers struggle with manual or inefficient management processes. As they grow, issues like slow searches, limited functionality, and data errors become more pronounced, impacting their financial performance.
    - To address these challenges, we've developed an application tailored for English center management. Our user-friendly interface and robust features streamline operations, improve the student experience, and enhance communication between teachers and students, ultimately boosting efficiency and performance.
- ### Research problems
    - Most English centers apply technology into their management works. However, normal desktop management applications (Excel for example) doesn't allow remote collaboration for other teachers and administrators, it is very vulnerable to security breaches if not properly protected and would put students and teachers information at risk. Most tasks are not automated in normal management applications and it would be very time-consuming for businesses to do it step-by-step. If your English center grows, you may find it increasingly difficult to manage all of the data using only applications like Excel and this can lead to a lack of organization, communication difficulties, and other issues. Last but not least, normal applications don't allow storage of study documents, that means the only way for students Information System Analysis and Design Instructors: PhD. Cao Thi Nhan, M.S. Duong Phi Long University of Information Technology 6 Faculty of Information Systems to finish their course work or just study is either to go to offline class or get a copy of the document.
    - The best way to resolve these problems is to have an application that can automate all these processes, with user-friendly UI and with multiple functionality suitable for students and teachers is to make manage more efficient.
- ### Objectives of the project
    Our application was created in order to achieve faster searching for large databases, and improve online communication between teachers and students. Here are some of our appâ€™s main features:
    - Management of enrollment and placement test.
    - Student/Teacher management.
    - User management.
    - Academic management.
    - Classroom management.
    - Academic results management.
    - Revenue, expenditure and finance management.
    - Analysis/report.
    - Data recovery and Backup.
- ### Scope of project | Limitations of the study
    Due to the lack of time, human and expenses, we couldnâ€™t finish all of the features above the objective of our projects. Here are some of our main features that we spent the most time on:
    - Assign user roles to the system.
    - Class, lesson management
    - User management.
    - Course, chapter management.
    - Generate schedule.
    - Attendance tracking.
    - Classroom management.
    - Analysis/Report.
- ### Development tools
    - Visual Studio Code/ IntelliJ IDEA as code editor.
    - Java as the main programming language.
    - Oracle database as database management system.
    - Figma for UI designing.
    - StarUML for UML Diagraming
