## üìÑ **Project Overview**
This is my personal project, carried out with other team members in the same course. This project is the first step for me to gain knowledge and practical experience in system analysis and design.

## üìã **Introduction**
- ### Introduction
    - The global demand for English language learning has led to the proliferation of English centers. However, many of these centers struggle with manual or inefficient management processes. As they grow, issues like slow searches, limited functionality, and data errors become more pronounced, impacting their financial performance.
    - To address these challenges, we've developed an application tailored for English center management. Our user-friendly interface and robust features streamline operations, improve the student experience, and enhance communication between teachers and students, ultimately boosting efficiency and performance.
- ### Research problems
    - Many English centers use technology for management, but traditional desktop applications like Excel lack remote collaboration and can pose security risks. They're not automation-friendly, leading to time-consuming tasks. As English centers grow, managing data becomes challenging, causing disorganization and communication issues. Additionally, they don't offer storage for study materials, limiting student access. To address these issues, an application with automation, user-friendly UI, and diverse functionality is essential for efficient management.
- ### Objectives of the project
    Our application was created in order to achieve faster searching for large databases, and improve online communication between teachers and students. Here are some of our app‚Äôs main features:
    - Management of enrollment and placement test.
    - Student/Teacher management.
    - User management.
    - Academic management.
    - Classroom management.
    - Academic results management.
    - Revenue, expenditure and finance management.
    - Analysis/report.
    - Data recovery and Backup.
- ### Scope of project | Limitations of the study
    Due to the lack of time, human and expenses, we couldn‚Äôt finish all of the features above the objective of our projects. Here are some of our main features that we spent the most time on:
    - Assign user roles to the system.
    - Class, lesson management
    - User management.
    - Course, chapter management.
    - Generate schedule.
    - Attendance tracking.
    - Classroom management.
    - Analysis/Report.
- ### Development tools
    - Visual Studio Code/ IntelliJ IDEA as code editor.
    - Java as the main programming language.
    - Oracle database as database management system.
    - Figma for UI designing.
    - StarUML for UML Diagraming
